        <p> There are all sorts of buses in the world and we have a selection of the finest. <br>
        We love and take excellent care of them, and we are more than happy to share them with you. <br>
        Taking a ride on a timeless bus enables you to go on an exciting and unforgettable journey through the previous century. <br>
        The principle of our collection is to have the classic, but also the most innovative buses from each decade. <br>
        Thus, we have no duplicates â€“ each bus has its own history and special features. <br> Some ride fast on highways,
        but cannot manoeuvre in the city, others are incapable of either but are simply stunning to look at. <br>
        All our buses are renovated or preserved according to the best practices in historic <br> preservation and we always 
        keep the sustainability principle in mind when we use them. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
        The buses are primarily meant for convenient and carefree travel from point A to point B, <br> located in Estonia. 
        Timeless buses enable traveling in space and time. <br>
        Journey in to the past can be much more grasping than life in present or future expectations. <br> This experience is 
        available for only those who know how to appreciate it. 
        Timeless buses are suitable for <br> covering longer distances only if you understand that the people who lived before us 
        endured loud engine noise, <br> insufficient ventilation and uncomfortable seating. 
        However, the smell of fuel and <br> unexpected technical difficulties may also result in permanent anger towards the 
        entire historical legacy of technology. <br>
        So think carefully before you decide to use the timeless buses for an event.
